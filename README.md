# MJML Email Builder
A responsive email template builder incorporating MJML + Gulp. The example template is a mock-up email newsletter I designed and developed to go along with my Photo Gallery App.

## Technologies
- MJML -> <a href="https://mjml.io/documentation/" target="_blank">Documentation</a>
- Gulp -> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp" target="_blank">Documentation</a>

## Running Locally
- clone repo<br />
- cd into ```mjml-email-builder``` directory<br />
- run ```npm install```<br />
- run ```gulp```<br />

Running Gulp will compile all MJML files into one ```index.html``` file within the ```build/``` directory.
